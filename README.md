README
=======

PubSub/A is an interface proposal for libraries implementing the [Publish/Subscribe][pubsub-pattern]
pattern (also often referred to as Observer pattern). The aim of PubSub/A is to provide a unified,
asynchronous common API for pubsub (similiar to the Promise/A proposal that defines a unified API
for promises).

PubSub/A uses the so-called *topic-based Publish/Subscribe* with the additional concept of
*channels* for grouping together topics. But besides string topics, it is also possible to use
custom object instance (or DOM nodes) as message hubs.

A [reference implementation written in TypeScript (but usable from plain JavaScript) is available
here][reference-implementation], as well as a
[network-transparent implementation][pubsub-server-node] that allows publish/subscribe across
node.js and browser instances using WebSockets.


Quick syntax overview
------

### Topic based

```javascript
var pubsub = new PubSubImplementation();

// channels are used to group topics
var channel = pubsub.channel('mychannel');

// subscribe
channel.subscribe('myTopic', function(arg) {
  console.log('I received a notification: ' + arg.message);
});

// publish - you can pass any custom object as argument
channel.publish('myTopic', { message: 'Hello world!' });

```

### Object-instance based (no string topics)

```javascript
var pubsub = new PubSubImplementation();

// use any object instance or DOM node you like
var myObject = {};

// add publish/subscribe functions to the object
PubSubImplementation.includeIn(myObject);

myObject.subscribe(function(arg) {
  console.log('I received a notification: ' + arg.message);
});

// publish - you can pass any custom object as argument
myObject.publish({ message: 'Hello world!' });
```

Specification
-------------

The specification is included in the [SPECIFICIATION.md file](SPECIFICATION.md). The interface
definitions in this project are written as TypeScript interfaces to provide a statically typed API
for better understanding. As this project only includes interfaces and not actual implementations,
the resulting output from the TypeScript compiler is an empty JavaScript file.

Implementations
---------------

* [pubsub-micro] - A reference implementation written in TypeScript but usable from any JavaScript
  project
* [pubsub-server-node] - A network-transparent implementation that can forward publish/subscribe
  message through the web (via WebSockets) using a tiny node.js server

Test suite
----------

This project includes a number of unit tests (using Jasmine and Karma) that can be used to verify
compatibility with the spec. To add you implementation, add a reference to the `karma.conf.js` file
and register a factory that returns your PubSubImplemenation and start Karma.


Licensing
---------

This project does not include any actual code that you could license (see the individual
implementations for their licensing). The documentation and test suite contained in this project are
